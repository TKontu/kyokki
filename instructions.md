# Priority principles

1. Build good quality robust modular code.
2. Apply separation of concerns and isolation to create a system which can be managed with limited context.
3. Employ test driven development practices, first implement test then develop
4. Plan before implementation. Analyze, Think, plan and refactor TODO.md with detailed plan
5. Utilize only minimum amount and absolutely necessary logging in order not to flood the CLI
